			<h3>“Live Unafraid, Die Strong.” A simple phrase, synonymous with other phrases but this one rings true.
				I’ve been involved in plenty of harrowing situations where it was “me or the bad guy” as a police officer.
				Very quickly I realized peak physical wellness was vital, not only in life or death situations but
				in everyday life as well. Never have I been afraid of danger, in that I personally study “Odinism”
				or Norse Mythology. Vikings knew their destiny so they lived and died unafraid and strong.
				This lifestyle is what I wanted to instill in others. Steps by me were taken to promote combat
				preparedness and fitness in the county I patrolled by opening a free weight lifting class.
				This sparked my interest in powerlifting and assisting others to achieve greatness.
				With some study I rapidly grew in size and strength, learning what I could from fitness pros
				like Jay Cutler, Kai Greene, Jim Stoppani and the like. In time I gained a handful of endorsements
				to competitively lift. While I never placed in my competitions I learned so much from men and women
				above me. I took that experience and molded it into what you see today… The Iron Viking brand is
				here and I plan to outfit everyone in the best gym gear around!
